# Ouroboros v4.10.2 — Architecture & Reference

This document describes every component, page, button, API endpoint, and data flow.
It is the single source of truth for how the system works. Keep it updated.

### Two-process model

1. **launcher.py** — immutable outer shell (lives inside the `.app` bundle, not in the git repo). Never self-modifies. Handles:
   - PID lock (single instance)
   - Bootstrap: copies workspace to `~/Ouroboros/repo/` on first run
   - Core file sync: overwrites safety-critical files on every launch
   - Starts `server.py` as a subprocess via embedded Python
   - Shows PyWebView window pointed at `http://127.0.0.1:8765`
   - Monitors subprocess; restarts on exit code 42 (restart signal)
  - First-run wizard (shared desktop/web onboarding for multi-key and optional local setup)
   - **Graceful shutdown with orphan cleanup** (see Shutdown section below)

2. **server.py** — self-editable inner server. Can be modified by the agent.
   - Starlette app with HTTP API + WebSocket
   - Runs supervisor in a background thread
   - Supervisor manages worker pool, task queue, message routing
   - Local model lifecycle endpoints extracted to `ouroboros/local_model_api.py`

## 2. Startup / Onboarding Flow

```
launcher.py main()
  │
  ├── acquire_pid_lock()        → Show "already running" if locked
  ├── check_git()               → Show "install git" wizard if missing
  ├── bootstrap_repo()          → Copy workspace to ~/Ouroboros/repo/ (first run)
  │                               OR sync core files (subsequent runs)
  ├── _run_first_run_wizard()   → Show shared setup wizard if no runnable config
  │                               (access entry → models → review mode → budget → summary)
  │                               Saves to ~/Ouroboros/data/settings.json
  ├── agent_lifecycle_loop()    → Background thread: start/monitor server.py
  └── webview.start()           → Open PyWebView window at http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

### First-run wizard

Shown when `settings.json` does not contain any supported remote provider key and has no
`LOCAL_MODEL_SOURCE`.

- Existing OpenRouter, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Cloud.ru, or local-model-source settings skip the wizard automatically.
- The wizard is shared between desktop and web: one HTML/CSS/JS onboarding flow is rendered directly in pywebview for desktop and injected into a blocking web overlay for Docker/browser runs.
- The wizard is multi-step and provider-aware: it starts with a single access step that accepts multiple remote keys plus optional local-model setup, then shows visible model defaults, a dedicated review-mode step, a dedicated budget step, and the final summary before save.
- When an Anthropic key is present, onboarding shows an optional `Install Claude Code CLI` CTA plus `Skip for now`.
  The copy is explicitly about the CLI, not the SDK.
- Desktop first-run uses the same onboarding bundle and talks to Claude CLI install/status through `pywebview` bridge methods.
  Web onboarding uses `/api/claude-code/status` and `/api/claude-code/install`.
- The wizard blocks progression if nothing runnable is configured.
- When OpenRouter is absent and official OpenAI is the only configured remote runtime, untouched default model values are auto-remapped to `openai::gpt-5.4` / `openai::gpt-5.4-mini` so first-run startup does not strand the app on OpenRouter-only defaults.
- `web_search` uses the official OpenAI Responses API only. It requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` and treats any non-empty `OPENAI_BASE_URL` as an incompatible custom runtime configuration rather than a fallback.
- OpenAI-compatible and Cloud.ru remain explicit model-selection flows from the full Settings page because there is no single safe universal default model ID for those providers.
- Closing the wizard without saving is non-fatal: the main app still launches and the user can finish configuration in Settings.

### Core file sync (`_sync_core_files`)

On every launch (not just first run), these files are copied from the workspace
bundle to `~/Ouroboros/repo/`, ensuring safety-critical code cannot be permanently
corrupted by agent self-modification:

- `prompts/SAFETY.md`
- `ouroboros/safety.py`
- `ouroboros/tools/registry.py`

---

## 3. Web UI Pages & Buttons

The web UI is a single-page app (`web/index.html` + `web/style.css` + ES modules).
`web/app.js` is the thin orchestrator (~90 lines) that imports from `web/modules/`:
- `ws.js` — WebSocket connection manager
- `utils.js` — shared utilities (markdown rendering, escapeHtml, matrix rain)
- `chat.js` — chat page with message rendering, live task card, compact runtime controls, and budget pill
- `logs.js` — log viewer with category filters and grouped task cards
- `log_events.js` — shared event summarization/grouping helpers used by Chat and Logs
- `files.js` — file browser, preview, uploads, and editor
- `evolution.js` — evolution chart (Chart.js) + versions sub-tab (git commits, tags, rollback, promote)
- `settings.js` — settings form with local model management
- `settings_controls.js` — searchable model pickers + segmented effort controls
- `costs.js` — cost breakdown tables
- `about.js` — about page

Navigation is a left sidebar with 7 pages (Chat, Files, Logs, Costs, Evolution, Settings, About).

### 3.1 Chat

- **Status badge** (top-right): "Online" (green) / "Thinking..." / "Working..." (amber pulse) / "Reconnecting..." (red).
  Driven by WebSocket connection state, typing events, and live task state.
- **Header controls**: compact buttons for `/evolve`, `/bg`, `/review`, `/restart`, `/panic` — the canonical location for runtime controls.
- **Budget pill**: compact amber pill in the header showing `$spent / $limit` with a mini progress bar, updated from `/api/state` polling every 3 seconds.
- **Message input**: textarea + send button. Shift+Enter for newline, Enter to send.
- **Input recall**: ArrowUp / ArrowDown cycles through recent submitted messages without leaving the textarea.
- **Messages**: user bubbles (right, blue-tinted), assistant bubbles (left, crimson), and system-summary bubbles (left, amber). Non-user bubbles render markdown.
- **Multi-user visibility**: user messages are now session-aware. The current browser session stays labeled as `You`; other Web UI sessions render as `WebUI (<session>)`; Telegram-origin messages render with their Telegram sender label.
- **Timestamps**: smart relative formatting (today: "HH:MM", yesterday: "Yesterday, HH:MM", older: "Mon DD, HH:MM"). Shown on hover.
- **Live task card**: reasoning/progress/tool chatter no longer spams the transcript as many assistant bubbles.
  Chat listens to `log_event`/task events plus progress messages and collapses them into one expandable task card with a timeline of steps.
- **Recoverable step failures**: step-level shell/tool failures stay as timeline notes and no longer freeze the card in a terminal `Issue` state.
  Later progress updates can retake the headline until the task actually finishes.
- **System summaries**: `direction="system"` entries from `chat.jsonl` are shown in the same timeline with a 📋 label instead of being hidden or treated as user text.
- **Typing indicator**: animated "thinking dots" bubble appears when the agent is processing.
- **Persistence**: chat history loaded from server on page load (`/api/chat/history`), survives app restarts. Fallback to sessionStorage.
- **Duplicate-bubble prevention**: queued local user bubbles carry a `client_message_id`; echoed WebSocket/history messages with the same id are merged instead of duplicated.
- **Empty-chat init**: if neither server history nor sessionStorage has messages, the UI shows a transient assistant bubble: `Ouroboros has awakened`. This is visual-only and is not written to chat history.
- **Telegram bridge**: Web UI initiated chats can be mirrored into the bound Telegram chat, Telegram text input is injected back into the same live chat timeline, and Telegram photos are bridged as image-aware user messages (including while a direct-chat turn is already running).
- Messages sent via WebSocket `{type: "chat", content: text, sender_session_id: "uuid"}`.
- Responses arrive via WebSocket `{type: "chat", role, content, ts, source?, sender_label?, sender_session_id?, client_message_id?}` and `{type: "photo", role, image_base64, mime, caption?, ts, source?, sender_label?}`. On page-load history sync, `/api/chat/history` can also return `role: "system"` entries for internal summaries plus metadata for multi-user reconstruction.
- Supports slash commands: `/status`, `/evolve`, `/review`, `/bg`, `/restart`, `/panic`.

### 3.2 Files

- **Browser pane**: directory tree for the configured root, breadcrumb navigation, inline filter, refresh button,
  create-file/create-directory actions, clipboard-style copy/move/paste, and delete/download context menu.
- **Preview pane**: text preview/editor, image preview, binary-file placeholder, and drag-drop upload target.
- **Write safety**: unsaved text edits are guarded on folder switches, file switches, page navigation, and browser refresh.
- **Root policy**: localhost requests fall back to the current user's home directory when no root is configured.
  Network/Docker access requires an explicit `OUROBOROS_FILE_BROWSER_DEFAULT` directory.
- **Network policy**: `OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD` is optional. When configured, non-loopback browser/API access is gated.
  When omitted, the full HTTP/WebSocket surface remains reachable by design. `/api/health` always stays public.
- **Symlink policy**: entries are constrained lexically to the configured root, but symlink targets may resolve outside that root intentionally.
  External symlink paths support list/read/download/content/write/mkdir/upload/copy/move/delete. Root-delete protection still applies only to the configured root itself.
- **Transfer semantics**: copy/move of symlink entries preserves the link object; writing through a symlink-backed file edits the target content.
- **Bounds**: directory listings are capped, previews are bounded to a text/byte limit, and uploads reject oversized payloads.

### 3.3 Dashboard (removed in v4.10.0)

The Dashboard tab has been removed. Its functionality is now distributed:
- **Budget**: shown as a compact pill in the Chat header (polls `/api/state` every 3s).
- **Evolve/BG toggles**: Chat header buttons (glow when active).
- **Review/Restart/Panic**: Chat header buttons.
- **Runtime status (evolution/consciousness detail)**: Evolution page runtime card.

### 3.4 Settings

- **Tabbed layout**: `Providers`, `Models`, `Integrations`, `Advanced`.
- **Provider cards**: OpenRouter, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Cloud.ru, Anthropic, plus optional Network Password. Cards are collapsible and use masked-secret inputs with show/hide toggles.
- **API Keys**: OpenRouter, OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Cloud.ru, Anthropic, Telegram Bot Token, GitHub Token, and Network Password.
  Keys are displayed as masked values (e.g., `sk-or-v1...`), can be explicitly cleared, and are only overwritten on save if the user enters a new value (not containing `...`).
- **Claude Code CLI CTA**: when Anthropic is configured, the Anthropic card exposes `Install Claude Code CLI` plus live install/status text.
  This installs the `claude` binary, not the SDK.
- **Models**: Main, Code, Light, Fallback.
- **Model catalog**: optional `Refresh Model Catalog` action calls `/api/model-catalog`. Failures are non-fatal and surfaced as inline warnings.
- **Model pickers**: searchable provider-aware pickers replace legacy raw dropdowns for remote models.
- **Provider prefixes**:
  - OpenRouter model values stay unprefixed (`anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`).
  - OpenAI model values use `openai::...`.
  - OpenAI-compatible model values use `openai-compatible::...`.
  - Cloud.ru model values use `cloudru::...`.
- **Reasoning Effort**: Five segmented controls for task/chat, evolution, review, scope review, and consciousness.
  Backed by `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_TASK`, `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_EVOLUTION`, `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_REVIEW`,
  `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_SCOPE_REVIEW`, `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_CONSCIOUSNESS`. Loading falls back to legacy
  `OUROBOROS_INITIAL_REASONING_EFFORT` for task/chat when the new key is absent.
- **Review Models**: Comma-separated remote model IDs for pre-commit review.
  Backed by `OUROBOROS_REVIEW_MODELS`.
- **Scope Review Model**: Single model for the blocking scope reviewer.
  Backed by `OUROBOROS_SCOPE_REVIEW_MODEL` (default `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`).
- **OpenAI-only review fallback**: if official OpenAI is the only configured remote runtime and the review list is invalid/underspecified, review falls back to the main model repeated three times.
- **Review Enforcement**: `Advisory` or `Blocking` for pre-commit review behavior.
  Backed by `OUROBOROS_REVIEW_ENFORCEMENT`. Review always runs in both modes.
- **Advanced**: local model runtime, max workers, total budget, per-task soft threshold, tool timeout, soft/hard timeout, web search model, review enforcement, legacy compatibility, and reset controls.
- **Local Model Runtime**: source, GGUF filename, port, GPU layers, context length, chat format, start/stop/test buttons, live local-model status.
- **Telegram**: Bot Token and primary chat id. If no primary chat id is pinned, the bridge binds to the first active Telegram chat and keeps replies attached there.
- **GitHub**: Token + Repo (for remote sync).
- **Save Settings** button → POST `/api/settings`. Applies to env immediately.
  Budget and tool-timeout changes take effect immediately; provider/runtime changes may still require restart.
- **Reset All Data** button (Danger Zone) → POST `/api/reset`.
  Deletes: state/, memory/, logs/, archive/, settings.json.
  Keeps: repo/ (agent code).
  Triggers server restart. On next launch, onboarding wizard appears.

### 3.5 Logs

- **Filter chips**: Tools, LLM, Errors, Tasks, System, Consciousness.
  Toggle on/off to filter log entries.
- **Clear** button: clears the in-memory log view (not files on disk).
- Log entries arrive via WebSocket `{type: "log", data: event}`.
- The page renders a live timeline: standalone system/error entries stay as rows, while task/LLM/tool/progress events with a shared `task_id` collapse into grouped task cards with an expandable internal timeline.
- Chat and Logs share the same event summarization logic from `log_events.js`, so a task phase is described the same way in both places.
- Each standalone row or grouped task card has a **Raw** toggle that expands the latest original JSON payload.
- New live-only timeline events cover task start, context building, LLM round start/finish,
  tool start/finish/timeout, and compact task heartbeats during long waits.
- Repeated startup/system events such as verification bursts are compacted in the UI.
- Max 500 entries in view (oldest removed).

### 3.6 Versions (merged into Evolution in v4.10.0)

The standalone Versions tab has been merged into the Evolution page as a sub-tab.
See section 3.8 (Evolution) for the combined page.

### 3.7 Costs

- **Total Spent / Total Calls / Top Model** stat cards at top.
- **Breakdown tables**: By Model, By API Key, By Model Category, By Task Category.
  Each row shows name, call count, cost, and a proportional bar.
- **Refresh** button reloads data from `/api/cost-breakdown`.
- Data auto-loads when the page becomes active (MutationObserver on class).

### 3.8 Evolution

Two sub-tabs ("Chart" and "Versions"), switchable via pill buttons in the page header.

**Chart sub-tab (default):**
- **Runtime status card**: evolution mode / consciousness pills, cycle count, queue, budget remaining, last evolution timestamp, next wakeup.
- **Chart**: interactive Chart.js line graph showing code LOC, prompt sizes (BIBLE, SYSTEM),
  identity, scratchpad, and total memory growth across all git tags.
- **Dual Y-axes**: left axis for Lines of Code, right axis for Size (KB).
- **Tags table**: detailed breakdown per tag with all metrics.
- Data fetched from `/api/evolution-data` (cached 60s server-side).
- Chart.js bundled locally (`web/chart.umd.min.js`) — no CDN dependency.

**Versions sub-tab:**
- **Current branch + SHA** displayed at top.
- **Recent Commits** list with SHA, date, message, and "Restore" button.
- **Tags** list with tag name, date, message, and "Restore" button.
- **Restore** button → POST `/api/git/rollback` with target SHA/tag.
  Creates rescue snapshot, resets to target, restarts server.
- **Promote to Stable** button → POST `/api/git/promote`.
  Updates `ouroboros-stable` branch to match `ouroboros`.
- Data loaded on first visit to the Versions sub-tab.
- **Refresh** button reloads data for the active sub-tab.

## 4. Server API Endpoints

If `OUROBOROS_NETWORK_PASSWORD` is configured, non-loopback HTTP/WebSocket access requires
authentication. If the password is blank, non-loopback access stays open by design.
`/api/health`, `/auth/login`, and `/auth/logout` remain reachable without an existing session.

## 5. Supervisor Loop

Runs in a background thread inside `server.py:_run_supervisor()`.

Each iteration (0.5s sleep):
1. `rotate_chat_log_if_needed()` — archive chat.jsonl if > 800KB
2. `ensure_workers_healthy()` — respawn dead workers, detect crash storms
3. Drain event queue (worker→supervisor events via multiprocessing.Queue)
4. `enforce_task_timeouts()` — soft/hard timeout handling
5. `enqueue_evolution_task_if_needed()` — auto-queue evolution if enabled
6. `assign_tasks()` — match pending tasks to free workers
7. `persist_queue_snapshot()` — save queue state for crash recovery
8. Poll `LocalChatBridge` inbox for user messages
9. Route messages: slash commands → supervisor handlers; text → agent

### Slash command handling (server.py main loop)

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/panic` | Kill workers (force), request restart exit |
| `/restart` | Save state, safe_restart (git), kill workers, exit 42 |
| `/review` | Queue a review task |
| `/evolve on\|off` | Toggle evolution mode in state, prune evolution tasks if off |
| `/bg start\|stop\|status` | Control background consciousness |
| `/status` | Send status text with budget breakdown |
| (anything else) | Route to agent via `handle_chat_direct()` |

---

## 6. Agent Core

### Task lifecycle

1. Message arrives → `handle_chat_direct(chat_id, text, image_data)`
2. Creates task dict `{id, type, chat_id, text}`
3. `OuroborosAgent.handle_task(task)` →
   a. Build context (`context.py`): system prompt + bible + identity + scratchpad + runtime info + Memory Registry digest
   b. `run_llm_loop()`: LLM call → tool execution → repeat until final text response
   c. Emit final `send_message`, `task_metrics`, and `task_done`; any restart request is latched until after those final events are queued
   d. Store task result synchronously; task summary and reflection run off the user-reply critical path
4. Events flow back to supervisor via event queue

### Tool capability sets (tool_capabilities.py)

Single source of truth for all tool classification sets:
- **`CORE_TOOL_NAMES`** — tools available from round 1 (no `enable_tools` needed)
- **`META_TOOL_NAMES`** — discovery tools (`list_available_tools`, `enable_tools`)
- **`READ_ONLY_PARALLEL_TOOLS`** — safe for concurrent execution in ThreadPoolExecutor
- **`STATEFUL_BROWSER_TOOLS`** — require thread-sticky executor (Playwright affinity)
- **`REVIEWED_MUTATIVE_TOOLS`** — tools (`repo_commit`, `repo_write_commit`) that must NOT
  end with ambiguous timeouts; executor waits synchronously for the final result
- **`UNTRUNCATED_TOOL_RESULTS`** — tools whose output must never be truncated
- **`UNTRUNCATED_REPO_READ_PATHS`** — repo files that must stay whole when read
- **`TOOL_RESULT_LIMITS`** — per-tool output size caps (chars)

`tool_policy.py` and `loop_tool_execution.py` import from this module. The legacy
copy in `tools/registry.py` (safety-critical, overwritten on restart) is kept for
backward compatibility but is not the runtime authority.

### Tool execution (loop.py)

- Pricing/cost estimation logic extracted to `pricing.py` (model pricing table, cost estimation, API key inference, usage event emission)
- **Per-task soft threshold**: Each task has a soft threshold (default $20, env `OUROBOROS_PER_TASK_COST_USD`). When a task exceeds this, the LLM is asked to wrap up soon. This is a reminder, not a hard stop.
- **`memory_tools.py`**: Provides `memory_map` (read the metacognitive registry of all data sources) and `memory_update_registry` (add/update entries). Part of the Memory Registry system (v3.16.0).
- **`tool_discovery.py`**: Provides `list_available_tools` (discover non-core tools) and `enable_tools` (activate extra tools for the current task). Enables dynamic tool set management.
- **`code_search`**: First-class code search tool in `tools/core.py`. Literal search by default, regex optional. Skips binaries, caches, vendor dirs. Bounded output (max 200 results, 80K chars). Available from round 1 as a core tool. Replaces the pattern of using `run_shell` with `grep`/`rg` for code search.
- Core tools always available; extra tools discoverable via `list_available_tools`/`enable_tools`
- Read-only tools can run in parallel (ThreadPoolExecutor)
- Browser tools use thread-sticky executor (Playwright greenlet affinity)
- All tools have hard timeout (default 600s, per-tool overrides for browser/search/vision); `OUROBOROS_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SEC` in `settings.json` is the runtime SSOT override read on each tool call.
- Multi-layer safety: hardcoded sandbox (registry.py) → deterministic whitelist → LLM safety supervisor
- Tool results use explicit per-tool caps with visible truncation markers (`repo_read`/`data_read`/`knowledge_read`/`run_shell`: 80k, default: 15k chars). Cognitive reads (`memory/*`, prompts, BIBLE/docs, commit/review outputs) are exempt from silent clipping.
- `run_shell` now treats non-zero exits as explicit failed tool outcomes and records exit/signal metadata in the tool trace.
- `run_shell` rejects `cmd` as a plain string with a clear error. The `cmd` parameter must always be a JSON array of strings.
- `set_tool_timeout` persists `OUROBOROS_TOOL_TIMEOUT_SEC` to `settings.json` and hot-applies it without restart.
- `ensure_claude_cli`, `/api/claude-code/*`, and desktop onboarding all reuse the same Claude Code install/status helpers.
- Claude Code install remains native-first (`install.sh` → Homebrew on macOS → npm fallback) and `claude_code_edit` still uses the installed CLI afterward.
- **`seal_task_transcript`**: called after compaction and before each `call_llm_with_retry`. Marks one stable tool-result boundary with `cache_control: ephemeral` to improve Anthropic prompt cache hits. Reverts all previous seals first so compaction always sees plain strings. Provider handling: OpenRouter (Anthropic models) passes list content blocks through as-is; direct Anthropic path preserves list content for `tool_result` (Anthropic API supports content blocks there); `_strip_cache_control` in `llm.py` now flattens tool-role list content back to a plain string for OpenAI, OpenAI-compatible, Cloud.ru, and local providers.
- **Reviewed mutative tool timeout handling** (v4.9.0): `repo_commit` and `repo_write_commit`
  are classified as `REVIEWED_MUTATIVE_TOOLS`. When they exceed the configured tool timeout,
  the executor emits a `tool_call_late` progress event but continues waiting synchronously
  for the real result (hard ceiling: 1800s). This prevents ambiguous "tool timed out, maybe
  still running" states for commit operations.
- Context compaction kicks in after round 8 (summarizes old tool results)

### Claude Agent SDK gateway (gateways/claude_code.py)

- **Pure transport adapter** for delegated code editing and advisory review
- Wraps the `claude-agent-sdk` Python package (`ClaudeSDKClient` with async message stream)
- Raises `ImportError` at module level when SDK is absent — callers fall back to CLI
- **Two execution modes:**
  - **Edit mode** (`run_edit`): `allowed_tools=["Read","Edit","Grep","Glob"]`,
    `disallowed_tools=["Bash","MultiEdit"]`, `permission_mode="acceptEdits"`,
    PreToolUse hook blocks writes outside `cwd` and to safety-critical files
  - **Read-only mode** (`run_readonly`): uses the simpler `query()` function with
    `allowed_tools=["Read","Grep","Glob"]`,
    `disallowed_tools=["Bash","Edit","Write","MultiEdit"]` (SDK enforces tool
    restrictions at the CLI level; no hooks needed)
- **Structured result**: `ClaudeCodeResult` dataclass with `success`, `result_text`,
  `session_id`, `cost_usd`, `usage`, `error`. Callers populate `changed_files`,
  `diff_stat`, and `validation_summary` (orchestration lives in tool layer)
- **Orchestration in callers**: project context injection (BIBLE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md,
  CHECKLISTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md), git stat, and post-edit validation live in
  `ouroboros/tools/shell.py` helpers — the gateway stays a pure transport boundary
- **Fallback**: if `claude-agent-sdk` is not installed, `claude_code_edit` and
  `advisory_pre_review` fall back to the legacy CLI subprocess path
- **Defense-in-depth**: post-edit revert in `registry.py` remains as secondary safety layer
- Safety-critical files mirror: `BIBLE.md`, `ouroboros/safety.py`,
  `ouroboros/tools/registry.py`, `prompts/SAFETY.md`

### Git tools (tools/git.py + tools/review.py + supervisor/git_ops.py)

- **`repo_write`** (v3.24.0): write file(s) to disk WITHOUT committing. Supports single-file
  (`path` + `content`) and multi-file (`files` array) modes. Preferred workflow:
  `repo_write` all files → `repo_commit` once with the full diff.
- **`repo_commit`**: stage + unified pre-commit review + commit + tests + auto-tag + auto-push.
  Includes `review_rebuttal` parameter for disputing reviewer feedback.
- **`repo_write_commit`**: legacy single-file write+commit (kept for compatibility).
  Also runs unified review before commit.
- **Unified pre-commit review** (v3.24.0): 3 models review staged diff against
  `docs/CHECKLISTS.md`. Review always runs before commit. `Blocking` mode keeps
  critical findings as hard gates; `Advisory` mode surfaces the same findings
  as warnings and lets the commit continue. Review history carried across
  blocking iterations. Quorum: at least 2 of 3 reviewers must succeed in
  blocking mode. Deterministic preflight catches VERSION/README mismatches
  before the expensive LLM call.
- **`pull_from_remote`**: fast-forward only pull from origin
- **`restore_to_head`**: discard uncommitted changes (review-exempt)
- **`revert_commit`**: create a revert commit for a specific SHA (review-exempt)
- **Auto-tag**: on VERSION change, creates annotated tag `v{VERSION}` after tests pass
- **Auto-push**: best-effort push to origin after successful commit (non-fatal)
- **Credential helper**: `git_ops.configure_remote()` stores credentials in repo-local
  `.git/credentials`. `migrate_remote_credentials()` migrates legacy token-in-URL origins.
  Both are wired at startup and on settings save.

### Safety system (safety.py + registry.py)

Multi-layer security:
1. **Hardcoded sandbox** (registry.py): deterministic blocks on safety-critical file writes, mutative git via shell, GitHub repo/auth commands. Runs BEFORE any LLM check.
2. **Deterministic whitelist** (safety.py): known-safe operations (read-only shell commands, repo writes already guarded by sandbox) skip LLM for speed.
3. **LLM Layer 1 (fast)**: Light model checks remaining tool calls for SAFE/SUSPICIOUS/DANGEROUS.
4. **LLM Layer 2 (deep)**: If flagged, heavy model re-evaluates with "are you sure?" nudge.
5. **Post-execution revert**: After claude_code_edit, modifications to safety-critical files are automatically reverted.
- Safety LLM calls now emit standard `llm_usage` events, so safety costs and failures appear in the same audit/health pipeline as other model calls.
`identity.md` is intentionally mutable (self-creation) and can be rewritten radically;
the constitutional guard is that the file itself must remain non-deletable.

### Background consciousness (consciousness.py)

- Daemon thread, sleeps between wakeups (interval controlled by LLM via `set_next_wakeup`)
- Loads full agent context: BIBLE, identity, scratchpad, knowledge base, drive state,
  health invariants, recent chat/progress/tools/events (same context as main agent)
- Owner messages are forwarded to background consciousness in full text (not first-100-char previews).
- Calls LLM with lightweight introspection prompt
- Has limited tool access (memory, messaging, scheduling, read-only)
- **Progress emission**: emits 💬 progress messages to UI via event queue + persists to `progress.jsonl`
- Pauses when regular task is running; deferred events queued and flushed on resume
- Budget-capped (default 10% of total)
- As of v3.16.1, CONSCIOUSNESS.md includes a concrete 7-item rotating maintenance checklist (dialogue consolidation, identity freshness, scratchpad freshness, knowledge gaps, process-memory freshness, tech radar, registry sync). One item is addressed per wakeup cycle.

### Block-wise dialogue consolidation (consolidator.py)

- Triggered after each task completion (non-blocking, runs in a daemon thread)
- Reads unprocessed entries from `chat.jsonl` in BLOCK_SIZE (100) message chunks
- Calls LLM (Gemini Flash) to create summary blocks stored in `dialogue_blocks.json`
- **Era compression**: when block count exceeds MAX_SUMMARY_BLOCKS (10), oldest blocks
  compressed into single "era summary" (30-40% of original length)
- **Auto-migration**: legacy `dialogue_summary.md` episodes auto-migrated to blocks
  on first consolidation run
- First-person narrative format ("I did...", "Anton asked...", "We decided...")
- Context reads blocks directly from `dialogue_blocks.json` instead of flat markdown

### Scratchpad auto-consolidation (consolidator.py)

- **Block-aware**: operates on `scratchpad_blocks.json` when blocks exist
- Triggered after each task when total block content exceeds 30,000 chars
- LLM extracts durable insights into knowledge base topics, compresses oldest blocks
- Falls back to flat-file mode for pre-migration scratchpads
- Writes knowledge files to `memory/knowledge/`, rebuilds `index-full.md`
- Uses platform-aware file locking to serialize concurrent calls
- Runs in a daemon thread (same pattern as dialogue consolidation)

### Execution reflection (reflection.py)

- Triggered at end of task when tool calls had errors or results contained
  blocking markers (`REVIEW_BLOCKED`, `TESTS_FAILED`, `COMMIT_BLOCKED`, etc.)
- Light LLM produces 150-250 word reflection capturing goal, errors, root cause, lessons
- Stored in `logs/task_reflections.jsonl`; last 20 entries loaded into dynamic context
- Pattern register: recurring error classes tracked in `memory/knowledge/patterns.md`
  via LLM, loaded into semi-stable context as "Known error patterns"
- Secondary reflection/pattern prompts use explicit truncation markers when compacted for prompt size; no silent clipping of these helper summaries.
- Runs synchronously (not in daemon thread) to avoid data loss on shutdown

### Crash report injection (agent.py)

- On startup, `_verify_system_state()` checks for `state/crash_report.json`
- If present, logs `crash_rollback_detected` event to `events.jsonl`
- File is NOT deleted — persists so `build_health_invariants()` surfaces
  CRITICAL: RECENT CRASH ROLLBACK on every task until the agent investigates

### Subtask lifecycle and trace summaries

- `schedule_task` now writes durable lifecycle states in `task_results/<id>.json`: `requested` → `scheduled` → `running` → terminal status (`completed`, `rejected_duplicate`, `failed`, etc.)
- Duplicate rejects are persisted explicitly, so `wait_for_task()` can report honest status instead of pretending the task is still running.
- Completed subtasks persist the full result text; parent tasks no longer see silently clipped child output.
- When a subtask completes, a compact trace summary is included alongside the full result.
- Parent tasks see tool call counts, error counts, and agent notes.
- Trace compaction remains explicit: max 4000 chars with visible omission markers, plus first/last 15 tool calls for long traces.

### Context building (context.py)

- As of v3.16.0, the Memory Registry digest (from `memory/registry.md`) is injected into every LLM context to enable source-of-truth awareness.
- As of v3.20.0, `patterns.md` (Pattern Register) is injected into semi-stable context, and execution reflections from `task_reflections.jsonl` are injected into dynamic context.
- As of v3.22.0, all docs are always in static context: BIBLE.md (180k), ARCHITECTURE.md (60k), DEVELOPMENT.md (30k), README.md (10k), CHECKLISTS.md (5k).
- `Health Invariants` are placed at the start of the dynamic context block, before drive state/runtime/recent sections, so warnings influence planning before the model reads the noisier tail sections.
- `build_recent_sections()` keeps recent dialogue broad, but task-scopes recent progress/tools/events when `task_id` is available.
- `build_health_invariants()` is split into focused helpers and now also surfaces recent provider/routing errors plus local context overflows.
- Local-model path no longer silently slices the live system prompt. It compacts non-core sections explicitly and raises an overflow error if core context still cannot fit.

### Review stack (advisory → triad → scope → commit)

The commit pipeline runs three review stages before creating a git commit:

1. **Advisory pre-review** (`tools/claude_advisory_review.py` + `review_state.py`)
2. **Triad diff review** (`tools/review.py`)
3. **Blocking scope review** (`tools/scope_review.py`)

Shared helpers live in `tools/review_helpers.py`: checklist section loader,
touched-file pack builder, broader repo pack builder, goal/scope resolution.

#### Advisory pre-review gate

- **`advisory_pre_review`** tool: runs a read-only Claude Code CLI review of the current
  worktree BEFORE `repo_commit`. Permitted tools: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` only (no Edit/Bash).
  Model pinned to `opus`. Prompt includes only the "Repo Commit Checklist" section from
  CHECKLISTS.md (precise section loader), plus BIBLE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md, touched-file pack,
  goal/scope sections, git status, and worktree diff.
- **`review_status`** tool: read-only diagnostic showing the last 5 advisory runs AND the
  last commit attempt state (status, block reason, actionable guidance).
- **`review_state.py`**: durable state. State file: `data/state/advisory_review.json`.
  Stores last 10 advisory runs plus the last `CommitAttemptRecord`.
  Advisory runs have: `snapshot_hash`, `commit_message`, `status`
  (fresh/stale/bypassed), `items`, `raw_result` (full, no truncation), audit fields.
  Commit attempts have: `status` (reviewing/blocked/succeeded/failed), `block_reason`
  (no_advisory/critical_findings/review_quorum/parse_failure/infra_failure/scope_blocked/preflight),
  `block_details`, `duration_sec`.
- **Snapshot hash**: deterministic SHA-256 of changed file content digests only.
  Commit message is NOT part of the hash (decoupled for less brittle freshness).
  Path-aware: `paths` parameter scopes the hash to specific files.
- **Stale lifecycle**: when a new fresh run is added, all previous runs with different
  hashes are automatically marked stale. `mark_all_stale_except()` makes this real.
- **Goal/scope params**: `advisory_pre_review` accepts optional `goal`, `scope`, `paths`
  parameters for intent-aware review.
- **Gate integration**: both `_repo_commit_push` and `_repo_write_commit` check freshness.
- **Bypass**: `skip_advisory_pre_review=True` — durably audited in `events.jsonl`.
- **Auto-bypass on missing key**: records a `bypassed` run when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` absent.
- **No-truncation for results**: advisory run results stored in full (no `[:4000]` clipping).
  Diff is capped at 80K chars with explicit omission note (not silent).

#### Triad diff review (enriched)

- Three models review the staged diff against "Repo Commit Checklist" from CHECKLISTS.md.
- **Full touched-file context**: reviewers see the complete current content of all changed
  files (via `build_touched_file_pack`), not just the patch hunks. Omission notes when
  files are too large or unreadable.
- **Goal section**: `build_goal_section` provides intended transformation context with
  precedence: goal > scope > commit_message > fallback. No raw task/chat text.
- Enforcement configurable: `blocking` or `advisory`.

#### Blocking scope review

- **Module**: `tools/scope_review.py`. Single-model (configurable via `OUROBOROS_SCOPE_REVIEW_MODEL`, default `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`). Reasoning effort via `OUROBOROS_EFFORT_SCOPE_REVIEW` (default `high`).
- **Fail-closed**: timeout, parse error, API failure, or incomplete context all block.
- **Role**: completeness, forgotten touchpoints, cross-surface consistency, incomplete
  migrations, intent mismatch. NOT a duplicate of line-by-line diff review.
- **Prompt includes**: "Intent / Scope Review Checklist" from CHECKLISTS.md, touched-file
  pack, broader repo pack (all tracked files minus touched), goal/scope sections,
  DEVELOPMENT.md, staged diff, review history.
- **Broader repo pack**: best-effort, up to 500K chars. Excludes touched files.
- Runs AFTER triad review, BEFORE `git commit`.
- Respects review enforcement setting (blocking/advisory).

### Deep review (review.py)

- As of v3.16.1, the review task includes an explicit Constitution (BIBLE.md) compliance mandate as the highest-priority review criterion.
- Full-codebase review for 1M-context models: all text files loaded without truncation
- Dry-run size estimation before loading (avoids OOM on huge repos)
- Fallback to chunked previews if codebase exceeds 600K token budget
- Security: skips sensitive files (.env, .pem, credentials.json, etc.)
- Per-file cap: 1MB
- Multi-model review now uses the shared async `LLMClient` OpenRouter path instead of raw one-off HTTP calls, so provider routing, Anthropic parameter requirements, usage normalization, and cache metadata are aligned with the rest of the runtime.

---

## 7. Configuration (ouroboros/config.py)

Single source of truth for:
- **Paths**: HOME, APP_ROOT, REPO_DIR, DATA_DIR, SETTINGS_PATH, PID_FILE, PORT_FILE
- **Constants**: RESTART_EXIT_CODE (42), AGENT_SERVER_PORT (8765)
- **Settings defaults**: all model names, budget, timeouts, worker count
- **Functions**: `load_settings()`, `save_settings()`,
  `apply_settings_to_env()`, `acquire_pid_lock()`, `release_pid_lock()`

## 8. Git Branching Model

- **ouroboros** — development branch. Agent commits here.
- **ouroboros-stable** — promoted stable version. Updated via "Promote to Stable" button.
- **main** — protected branch. Agent never touches it.

`safe_restart()` does `git checkout -f ouroboros` + `git reset --hard` on the repo.
Uncommitted changes are rescued to `~/Ouroboros/data/archive/rescue/` before reset.

---

## 9. Shutdown & Process Cleanup

**Requirement: closing the window (X button or Cmd+Q) MUST leave zero orphan
processes. No zombies, no workers lingering in background.**

### 9.1 Normal Shutdown (window close)

```
1. _shutdown_event.set()           ← signal lifecycle loop to exit
2. stop_agent()
   a. SIGTERM → server.py          ← server runs its lifespan shutdown:
      │                                kill_workers(force=True) → SIGTERM+SIGKILL all workers
      │                                then server exits cleanly
   b. wait 10s for exit
   c. if still alive → SIGKILL     ← hard kill (workers may orphan)
3. _kill_orphaned_children()        ← SAFETY NET
   a. _kill_stale_on_port(8765)    ← lsof port, SIGKILL any survivors
   b. multiprocessing.active_children() → SIGKILL each
4. release_pid_lock()               ← delete ~/Ouroboros/ouroboros.pid
```

This three-layer approach (graceful → force-kill server → sweep port/children)
guarantees no orphans even if the server hangs or workers resist SIGTERM.

### 9.2 Panic Stop (`/panic` command or Panic Stop button)

**Panic is a full emergency stop. Not a restart — a complete shutdown.**

The panic sequence (in `server.py:_execute_panic_stop()`):

```
1. consciousness.stop()             ← stop background consciousness thread
2. Save state: evolution_mode_enabled=False, bg_consciousness_enabled=False
3. Write ~/Ouroboros/data/state/panic_stop.flag
4. LocalModelManager.stop_server()   ← kill local model server if running
5. kill_all_tracked_subprocesses()   ← os.killpg(SIGKILL) every tracked
   │                                    subprocess process group (claude CLI,
   │                                    shell commands, and ALL their children)
6. kill_workers(force=True)          ← SIGTERM+SIGKILL all multiprocessing workers
7. os._exit(99)                      ← immediate hard exit, kills daemon threads
```

Launcher handles exit code 99:

```
7. Launcher detects exit_code == PANIC_EXIT_CODE (99)
8. _shutdown_event.set()
9. Kill orphaned children (port sweep + multiprocessing sweep)
10. _webview_window.destroy()        ← closes PyWebView, app exits
```

On next manual launch:

```
11. auto_resume_after_restart() checks for panic_stop.flag
12. Flag found → skip auto-resume, delete flag
13. Agent waits for user interaction (no automatic work)
```

### 9.3 Subprocess Process Group Management

All subprocesses spawned by agent tools (`run_shell`, `ensure_claude_cli`, `claude_code_edit`)
use `start_new_session=True` (via `_tracked_subprocess_run()` in
`ouroboros/tools/shell.py`). This creates a separate process group for each
subprocess and all its children.

On panic or timeout, the entire process tree is killed via
`os.killpg(pgid, SIGKILL)` — no orphans possible, even for deeply nested
subprocess trees (e.g., Claude CLI spawning node processes).

Active subprocesses are tracked in a thread-safe global set and cleaned up
automatically on completion or via `kill_all_tracked_subprocesses()` on panic.
`run_shell` surfaces timeout-vs-signal distinctions in its result text so
`exit_code=-9` no longer looks like a silent success in summaries/reflections.

## 10. Key Invariants

1. **Never delete BIBLE.md. Never physically delete `identity.md` file.**
   (`identity.md` content is intentionally mutable and may be radically rewritten.)
2. **VERSION == pyproject.toml version == latest git tag == README version == ARCHITECTURE.md header version**
3. **Config SSOT**: all settings defaults and paths live in `ouroboros/config.py`
4. **Message bus SSOT**: all messaging goes through `supervisor/message_bus.py`
5. **State locking**: `state.json` uses file locks for concurrent read-modify-write
6. **Budget tracking**: per-LLM-call cost events with model/key/category breakdown
7. **Core file sync**: safety-critical files are overwritten from bundle on every launch
8. **Zero orphans on close**: shutdown MUST kill all child processes (see Section 9)
9. **Panic MUST kill everything**: all processes (workers, subprocesses, subprocess
   trees, consciousness, evolution) are killed and the application exits completely.
   No agent code may prevent or delay panic. See BIBLE.md Emergency Stop Invariant.
10. **Architecture documentation**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` must be kept in sync with
    the codebase. Every structural change (new module, new API endpoint, new data file,
    new UI page) must be reflected here. This is the single source of truth for how
    the system works.
